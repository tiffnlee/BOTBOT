## BOTBOT -- Tiffany's own personal Discord Bot -- Call it BOTBOT

#### Discord.py based bot
* Discord.py must be installed in order to use this bot. It does not use the voice client.
* [Link to Discord.py's Git](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
* Credit where credit is due.

#### BOTBOT is filled with little tricks and sleeves
* Provides an interactive experience for people in my servers.
* Private for now.

#### How to use
* Right now you can't. Private.
* But, let's say you *could* use it, you would have to have Discord.py installed in your python environment. It must be Python 3.5+.
* Have a config file that contains your token and the extensions (in an array) that you want to use.
* Then just run `python3 SnailBot.py`.
